This goofy little game is provided to you as-is, with no guarantees other than the promise that it probably won't set your computer on fire. Copy it, modify it, share it, or print it out and frame it. Seriously, go wild.

Just don't blame us if a swarm of digital bugs escapes into the wild and your friends mock you for days. You've been warned.

Enjoy,
