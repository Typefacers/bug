## 🎭 Welcome to the Greatest Comedy in Software Development

_Ladies and gentlemen, feast your eyes on the most over-engineered bug-squashing simulator ever created by human hands. This project has more dependencies than a soap opera storyline and enough complexity to make a NASA engineer weep._

### 🤡 What Is This Magnificent Disaster?

This is a "bug bounty hackathon" project that ironically has more bugs than it fixes. It's a game where you squash digital insects while the real bugs multiply exponentially in the codebase behind the scenes. Think whack-a-mole, but the moles are your fading hopes and dreams.

### 🎪 Features That Will Blow Your Mind (And Your Bundle Size)

- 🐛 **Virtual Bug Extermination**: Because squashing real bugs requires actual skill
- 📊 **Dashboard with Fancy Charts**: D3.js charts now sport gradients, grids, and zoom
- 🏆 **Leaderboard System**: Compete with yourself since you're probably the only user
- 🎨 **Windows 95 UI**: Nothing says "modern web development" like nostalgic 30-year-old design
- 🗃️ **Zustand State Management**: Because Redux wasn't complicated enough, we needed something "simpler"
- ⚡ **Blazing Fast Vite**: The only thing fast about this project
- 🎭 **TypeScript**: Added types everywhere except where they're actually needed
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS**: 47KB of utility classes to style 3 buttons
- 🎬 **Framer Motion**: Animated everything because static websites are for quitters
- 🖥️ **Windows 95 Taskbar**: Because productivity peaks with a retro clock
- 📂 **Start Menu**: Authentic start menu for quick navigation
- 🔍 **Search & Filter**: Hunt bugs and leaderboard entries like a pro
- ⏰ **PTO Rewards**: Earn ridiculous amounts of time off for each bug you squash
- 🧹 **Automatic Cleanup**: Squashed bugs vanish on their own, only to respawn
- 🔮 **Bug Forecast**: Peer into tomorrow's infestation with predictive charts
- 🧮 **Dashboard Helpers**: Bounty totals and date formatting now live in a
  shared module
- 🚫 **Comical 404 Page**: Getting lost has never been so entertaining
- 🌦️ **Weather Forecast**: Plan your bug hunts around the faux forecast
- 🌑 **Konami Code Dark Mode**: Enter the secret code for a darker UI
- 🔐 **Real CVE Demo Data**: Bug list now features recent vulnerabilities like PAN-OS File Peek (CVE-2025-0111).
- ☕ **Coffee Overflow Bug**: Demo data now includes a caffeinated crash
- 🥠 **Fortune Cookie**: Random words of wisdom on its own tab, now full width with subtle animations
- 🔊 **Web Audio Effects**: Ambient drones and juicier bug-squash splats (even when shooting bugs on the canvas), plus a talking fortune cookie
- 🧩 **Captcha Protection**: Basic math challenge to keep bots at bay
- ✍️ **Sign Up Form**: Create your own bug-bashing persona
- 🔄 **Dependency Update**: Packages bumped to latest versions and unused
  dependencies removed
- 📄 **Job Description Page**: Read about the prestigious Bug Basher role

### 🎪 The Technology Circus

This project showcases the fine art of using 30 dependencies to accomplish what could be done with 3. We've got:

- **React 19**: For building a user interface that could've been static HTML
- **TypeScript**: Because JavaScript wasn't confusing enough
- **Tailwind CSS**: Why write 10 lines of CSS when you can write 100 class names?
- **Radix UI**: Premium headless components for basic HTML elements
- **D3.js**: Nuclear-powered charting library for displaying 5 data points
- **Framer Motion**: Hollywood-grade animations for hover effects
- **Zustand**: State management for 3 variables that could've been `useState`
- **UUID**: Industrial-strength ID generation for a client-side game
- **Lucide Icons**: 1000+ icons imported to use exactly 7

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd bug-bounty-hackathon
npm install
npm run dev
```

Common commands:

```bash
npm run build    # Create production build
npm test         # Run tests
npm run lint     # Lint code
npm run format   # Format code
```

CI runs `npm run lint:ci` so warnings won't crash the workflow.

### 🧪 Testing (Hold the Jest)

`npm test` uses Node's built‑in `node:test` runner. The command runs Node with
coverage enabled:

```bash
node --experimental-transform-types \
  --loader ./png-loader.js \
  --experimental-test-coverage \
  --test-coverage-include=src/components/** \
  --test-coverage-include=src/routes/** \
  --test
```

Coverage is limited to files in `src/components` and `src/routes`. Any `.ts`,
`.tsx`, `.js`, or `.jsx` file executed from those folders will appear in the
coverage summary. Results are saved to `coverage.txt` and the Test workflow
uploads them as an artifact and comments a short summary on pull requests.

The test suite now includes coverage for every page and component.
Coverage results are uploaded as an artifact in the Test workflow.
The workflow also comments a short coverage summary on pull requests.

### 🎭 Getting Started (Abandon Hope, All Ye Who Enter Here)

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js 18+ (because we're cutting edge like that)
- 16GB of RAM (for the node_modules folder)
- A therapist on speed dial
- Low expectations

**Installation Ritual:**

```bash
# Clone this monument to over-engineering
git clone <this-repo>
cd bug-bounty-hackathon

# Install dependencies (grab a coffee, maybe two)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Watch in horror as your CPU fan spins up
```

**Available Incantations:**

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development (prepare for frustration)
npm run build    # Create production build (good luck)
npm run preview  # Preview build (spoiler: it's broken)
npm run lint     # Find 47 linting errors you'll ignore
npm test         # Run the single test that actually works
npm run format   # Rearrange deck chairs on the Titanic
```

### 🎨 Architecture (A Beautiful Disaster)

```
src/
├── assets/          # 12 bug PNGs that total 2MB
├── components/      # 15 components that could be 3
│   └── ui/          # Radix UI wrappers because abstraction is life
├── lib/             # One utility function that could be inline
├── mock/            # Fake data more realistic than our deadlines
├── routes/          # 5 pages for a single-page concept
├── store.ts         # Global state for local variables
├── types/           # TypeScript definitions for obvious things
├── utils/           # Utilities that are less useful than comments
└── vite-env.d.ts    # Types for things that don't need types
```

### Naming Conventions

See [docs/NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md](docs/NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md) for the complete guide.

- **Folders**: lower-case names, hyphenated when needed.
- **Component files**: `PascalCase.tsx`.
- **Utilities**: lower-case with optional hyphens, e.g., `utils.ts`.
- **Test files**: same base name plus `.test.ts`.
- **Components**: export default components with names matching their file.
- **Variables/functions**: camelCase.
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **Types/interfaces**: PascalCase.

### 🎪 The Comedy Special Features

**🐛 Bug Component Showcase:**

- `BugArea.tsx`: Where bugs live rent-free
- `BugCard.tsx`: Instagram for insects
- `BugCrawler.tsx`: AI pathfinding for 2D sprites
- `BugCrawler.tsx` now updates positions using frame delta for smoother motion
- `bug-priority-ml.ts`: Logistic regression that pretends to rank urgency
- `AimCursor.tsx`: Mouse cursor replacement nobody asked for
- `BugTrendsChart.tsx`: Gradient-filled line chart with zoomable timelines
- `Taskbar.tsx`: Windows 95 clock for peak nostalgia
- `StartMenu.tsx`: Clickable start button menu
- `NotFound.tsx`: A 404 page with jokes for when routing fails

**📊 Dashboard Extravaganza:**

- Real-time metrics for imaginary users
- Charts that update faster than your actual productivity
- Progress bars that go backwards
- Search field and priority filters so you can pretend to triage

**🏆 Leaderboard Excellence:**

- Ranks users who don't exist
- Score persistence not yet implemented
- Displays achievements for playing alone
- Searchable table to find your imaginary rivals
- Helper functions exported for easier testing
- Pages wrapped in `React.memo` for smoother rendering

### 🎭 Performance Notes

- Initial bundle size: **Heavier than your student loan debt**
- Time to interactive: **Longer than your attention span**
- Lighthouse score: **We don't talk about the Lighthouse score**
- Memory usage: **Chrome tab killer**

### 🤹 Contributing (Please Don't)

This project is perfect as-is. Adding more code would be like putting a hat on a hat on a hat. However, if you insist on making it worse:

1. Fork the repo
2. Add more dependencies
3. Create unnecessary abstractions
4. Submit a PR with 200+ lines to change a single boolean
5. Watch the maintainers cry

### 🎪 License (Buyer Beware)

This project is licensed under the "Use At Your Own Risk" license. Side effects may include:

- Spontaneous questioning of life choices
- Sudden urge to learn backend development
- Chronic dependency addiction
- Existential dread about modern web development

### 🎭 Final Words

_This project proves that with enough determination, caffeine, and a complete disregard for best practices, you can turn a simple idea into a beautiful, complex nightmare. It's not the hero we needed, but it's the hero we deserved._

**Built with ❤️, poor decisions, and way too much free time.**
