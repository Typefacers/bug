# Naming Conventions

Welcome to our comedic guide on how to name things without losing your sanity. Follow these rules and your code will look sharp enough to cut through the boring stuff.

## Folders

- Keep folder names in lowercase because hitting the SHIFT key is a workout. Use hyphens when the name has more words than your lunch order.

## Files

- React components strut around in `PascalCase.tsx` and each one exports itself as the star of the show.
- Non-component utilities and modules prefer a laid-back lowercase vibe. Hyphens are welcome when they feel rebellious, e.g. `utils.ts`, `badge-variants.ts`.
- Test files faithfully mirror the module they're judging and end with a dramatic `.test.ts`.

## Code

- Variables and functions whisper politely in `camelCase`.
- Configuration constants shout from the rooftops in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Types and interfaces keep it classy with `PascalCase`.
